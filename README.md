# 📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course.
The goal of this project is to analyze a poorly designed website interface and redesign it to improve usability, user experience (UX), and user interface (UI) based on HCI principles.

The selected case study is the Damson Furniture Website, which suffers from multiple UI and UX issues that negatively affect user interaction and satisfaction.
